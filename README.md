## Rules

https://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/courses/395-2017-spring/parcheesi.html

## Install

1. make sure you have the latest version of `node.js` and `npm` installed
2. `git clone https://github.com/edysuh/parcheesijs`
3. in the project directory, execute `npm install`
4. typescript is compiled into javascript, so it is recommended to keep the compilation watcher running while working on the project; run `npm run tsc:w` in a separate terminal
5. run our tests using `npm test`

### Tournament Player

run the tournament player with `npm run play`.
